-Extend upon ReminderPro to add alert message if the current date passes the due date for a reminder.
-Host the application on a database online so multiple users can interact with the same reminders (Hint: the next application introduces authentication and databases. Perhaps you can revisit this one after!)
-Create an application of your own! Find a problem, and build a solution in ReactJS and Redux!
